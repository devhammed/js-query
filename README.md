# js-query

### A few little cheats for those trying to become _jQuery_-free.

It's not a very extensive replacement for _jQuery_, just a few things my projects have used the most.

I have nothing against _jquery_, I have been putting this together while actually learning _real_ "Vanilla" JavaScript. I will continue to add to it as I find use for additions, but probably not just to add them.
